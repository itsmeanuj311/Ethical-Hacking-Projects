# Ethical Hacking Projects for Beginners

## Overview

This repository contains seven beginner-level projects focused on ethical hacking and cybersecurity. Each project provides hands-on experience with essential techniques for network scanning, web application testing, password cracking, honeypot deployment, Wi-Fi auditing, phishing attack simulation, and SQL injection exploitation.
