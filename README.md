### üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
- `nmap` ‚Äì Port, OS, and service version scanning
- `Metasploit` ‚Äì Exploitation
- `John the Ripper` ‚Äì Password hash cracking
- Linux built-in commands ‚Äì user management and enumeration

## üöÄ Tasks Performed

### üîç Network Scanning
- `nmap -v IP` ‚Äì Basic scan
- `nmap -v -p- IP` ‚Äì Full port scan
- `nmap -sV IP` ‚Äì Service version detection
- `nmap -O IP` ‚Äì OS detection

### üîê Hidden Ports Discovered
Ports like `8787`, `36588`, `53204`, etc., found through full port scans.

### üì° Enumeration
- OS: Linux 2.6.x (Metasploitable)
- Open services: vsftpd, OpenSSH, Apache, MySQL, Samba, etc.
- Vulnerable ports: 21 (FTP), 445 (SMB), 512‚Äì514 (R Services)

### üí• Exploitation
- **vsftpd 2.3.4** backdoor
- **SMB 3.0.20-Debian** using Metasploit
- **Rexec/Rlogin/Rsh** services using script-based vulnerabilities

### üë§ Privilege Escalation
- Created user `rahul` with root permissions
- Extracted and cracked password hash using John the Ripper

### üîß Remediation Steps
| Service   | Vulnerability                  | Fix                              |
|-----------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| vsftpd    | Backdoor (CVE-2011-2523)       | Upgrade to 3.0.5 / use SFTP      |
| SMB       | RCE, Null Sessions             | Upgrade to Samba 4.20.1          |
| R Services| Plaintext creds (CVE-1999-0651)| Disable & use SSH instead        |

## üìö Major Learning

Through this project, I learned how to create and manage users in Linux, analyze system files, crack password hashes, and detect services using Nmap. I practiced using commands like `nmap -sV`, `nmap -O`, and `john` to identify system weaknesses. I also understood how outdated services like FTP, SMB, and R services pose serious security risks and how to patch or replace them.
